# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project 
This repository hosts the project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning data Data course.

The files in this repository are:
- `run_analysis.R`, the R file used in the project.
- `README.md`, this file explaining the contents.
- `CodeBook.md`, the codebook that describe the variables used and the work that was done.
- `tidy.txt`, the tidy dataset generated as asked on the step 5 of the project.

To use the `run_analysis.R` script you need to have the unzipped dataset directory, **UCI HAR Dataset**, in the same working directory, after that, you can use `source("run_analysis.R")` to run the script.

The dataset can be obtained in the following link: [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
